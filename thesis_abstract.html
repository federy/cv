        This study is devoted to the fluorescence spectroscopy of water molecules under pressure and confined in rare-gas clusters. A population of the excited states requires energy higher than 10 eV. This has been achieved by excitation involving two laser photons or one photon of synchrotron radiation. The goal of the study is to consider the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) method for in situ measures of temperatures in dense fluids.
        We developed a laser installation for studies of fluorescence of gases under vacuum conditions and under pressure up to 200 bar. For the first time, we have measured the two_photon fluorescence excitation spectra C̃(ν’=0, J’KaKc) ← X̃(ν’’=0, J’’KaKc) of H2O and D2O molecules in the spectral range between 245 and 250 nm. The experimental rsults have been confronted to our theorical calculations, which take into account homogeneous and heterogeneous state coupling and ionization by laser photons. Under the nitrogen pressure above 5 bar, we have observed a precipitation, which we have tentatively attributed to a formation of hydrates stabilized by OH(OD) groups.
        Multishell rare-gas (He, Ne, Ar) clusters doped with water molecules have been produced by crossbeam technic (Hasylab, Desy). We have observed for the first time the suppression of the excited ion yield from helium clusters. We have observed for the first time the suppression of the excited ion yield from helium clusters. We have observed that water molecules efficiently dope bulk sites of neon clusters. Moreover, the molecules are rotationally cooled insie these clusters down to 10 K. Argon clusters produce the “cage effect” on the H2O (D2O) predissociation channel, which provide the recombination of rapid H/D atoms with excited OH(A)/OD(A) fragments. We have observed the isotopic effect on the critical size of the Ar-cavity.
        This model study allows extension of the LIF method of temperature measurements for high gas pressures above 1 atm. A potential application for the rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) experiment is suggested.
